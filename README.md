# 📊 **Data Analytics Portfolio Project**

## **Overview**

This project showcases my data analytics skills, covering the entire data pipeline—from data exploration and cleaning to visualization and statistical analysis. The project consists of three distinct sections, each tackling a different dataset using SQL, Tableau, and Python.

## **Project Breakdown**

### 1️⃣ **Data Exploration using SQL – COVID-19 Dataset**

🔍 **Objective:** Gain insights into the global impact of COVID-19 using structured queries.
🛠 **Tech Stack:** SQL Server
📌 **Key Tasks:**

- Extracted and analyzed global COVID-19 data, including total cases, deaths, and recovery rates.
- Utilized SQL aggregate functions to calculate case fatality and recovery rates.
- Performed joins and subqueries to compare trends across countries and continents.
- Used CTEs, Temp Tables, and Window Functions for advanced data analysis.
📈 **Outcome:** Identified trends, peak case periods, and regional variations in COVID-19 impact.

### 2️⃣ **Data Visualization – COVID-19 Insights in Tableau**
🎨 **Objective**: Transform raw COVID-19 data into interactive dashboards for better decision-making.
🛠 **Tech Stack:** Tableau
📌 **Key Tasks:**

- Designed a dynamic **dashboard** showcasing total cases, deaths, and recovery trends globally.
- Created **bar charts, heatmaps, and time series** plots to visualize infection rates across countries.
- Implemented **filters and drill-down options** to allow user-driven insights.
📈 **Outcome:** An interactive, visually appealing dashboard that effectively conveys COVID-19 trends.

### 3️⃣ **Data Cleaning using SQL – Nashville Housing Data**
🧼 **Objective:** Prepare and clean raw housing data for analysis and reporting.
🛠 **Tech Stack:** SQL Server
